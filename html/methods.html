                            does popular stores among yelp reviewers really contribute to the livelyhood of physical space?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inspired by this question, we download review data from 15,000+ stores in Manhattan from Yelp,
                            and then we aggregate these reviews by physical street segments. In this way we could compare the aggregated online popularity
                            with the number of actual visits along these streets, here is what we found:

                        <p> To test how much does online reviews actually contribute to physical acitivites, we include other
                            variables in the model.</p>

                        <p> This model was able to achieve around 40% R-square, sigh... Then it means there are a lot
                            of variance could not be explained even after we control the neighborhood variables! Therefore,
                            use this model's residual, we define a O2O mismatch index, which is the residual from the OLS model
                            regressing the total street level visit on online reviews (including the number of reviews and the stars)
                            conditioning on other factors.

                            Our review data are downloaded from Yelp. We use most recent listings in Manhattan
                            areas to estimate the online popularity.

                        <p> To measure the inequality of a place, we use a
                            city-wide normalized measure. Because income
                            groups correspond to exactly 25% of the users in
                            the area, a totally equal place would be visited
                            by each income group 25% of the time. This
                            corresponds to a flat chart, like the one on the
                            left. We consider any deviation from that flat
                            profile to contribute to inequality. For example,
                            a totally segregated place would show a chart more
                            like the one on the right, with 100% of the users
                            coming from a single income group. Mathematically,
                            we calculate the absolute deviation of a place's
                            income distribution from that flat ideal:
