                    <p class="role">"As one of many yelp users, searching food online is part of my exploratory life." However, <strong>
                        does popular stores among yelp reviewers really contribute to the livelyhood of physical space?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Inspired by this question, we download review data from 15,000+ stores in Manhattan from Yelp,
                        and then we aggregate these reviews by physical street segments. In this way we could compare the aggregated online popularity
                        with the number of actual visits along these streets, here is what we found:

                <li><h2>2. Model Construction</h2>
                    <p class="role"> To test how much does online reviews actually contribute to physical acitivites, we include other
                        variables in the model.</p>
                        <p class="role">  * <strong>Physical Characteristics: </strong> <em>Does Beautiful Space Matter?</em></p>
                        <p class="role">  * <strong>Business Diversity and Transit: </strong><em>Jane Jacobs still right?</em> </p>

                        <p class="role">The graph below shows our preliminary results. The height of the bar indicates the significance of
                            each variable (how precise they are), and the length of the bar shows the effectiveness of each variable
                            (how much they contribute to the model). For example, the average star in each street increase 1 unit is
                            associated with around 35% increase in the offline visitor volume. But once the average star goes beyond 3.4, it
                            starts to associate with the decrease of offline visitor volume (refer to the quadratic term).

                    <p class="role"> This model was able to achieve around 40% R-square, sigh... Then it means there are a lot
                        of variance could not be explained even after we control the neighborhood variables! Therefore,
                        use this model's residual, we define a O2O mismatch index, which is the residual from the OLS model
                        regressing the total street level visit on online reviews (including the number of reviews and the stars)
                        and other built environment factors.
